# Problem set

This week you are required to reproduce the scatter diagram proposed by Tufte in his book 'The Display of Quantitative Information'. That visualization has, at least, two distinctive features:

- it embraces the data/ink ratio maximization principle
- it shows the x-y scatter diagram along with the univariate distributions of x and y 

You are supposed to deliver a Jupyter notebook/Python script containing the code that generates the chart, and, if applicable, the synthetic data you use. Yeap, you can either use real world data or synthetic (simulated) data. For example, you may want to reuse the Numpy code included in 'lab_1.py', in which I simulate schooling and wage data for a sample of 1,000 individuals.

Deadline: Tuesday 15, 2019 (8:00 PM). This is an individual submission. One student will be invited to present her/his solution to the class. One bonus point will be awarded to the selected student.
