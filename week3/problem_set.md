Problem set
===========

This problem set is based on the 'start-up growth' dataset used in week 3 class.

By Tuesday 22 (8:00 PM), you are supposed to deliver a Matplotlib figure with the following characteristics:

4 plots, arranged on 2 rows and 2 columns

+ plot 1 illustrates the heterogeneity in revenues within age cohorts  (j)
+ plot 2 illustrates the heterogeneity in revenues within age cohorts and sub-population (i.e., exponential, log, inverted-u growth type)
+ plot 3 illustrates the heterogeneity in revenue growth rates across start-ups (i)
+ plot 4 illustrates the heterogeneity in revenue growth rates within sub-populations and across start-ups.

Notes: Revenue growth rate is [r(j+1) - r(j)] / r(j); you're free to select the set of statistical charts that, in your opinion, best fits the task.
